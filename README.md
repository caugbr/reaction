# Reaction

Reaction links to posts and comments in Wordpress.

## Reaction icons
The available reactions are defined by image names without the file extension. 

## New image sets
You can create multiple sets of images by simply creating new folders in `/assets/img` and naming the images according to the reactions you want (`like.png`, `love.png`, etc.).
By this logic, you can have different reactions in each set.
